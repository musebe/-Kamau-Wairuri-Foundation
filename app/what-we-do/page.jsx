                Possession of digital Skills is crucial for young people to be
                able to access opportunities that allow them to fulfil their
                potential in the present-day world. We are committed to ensuring
                that young people, especially those in rural areas, have access
                to equipment and training that allows them to acquire and deepen
                digital skills. We do this by equipping computer labs in
                learning facilities and offering training sessions for young
                people at various stages in partnership with our partners.

                We support children from under-privileged backgrounds to access
                formal education in a dignified manner. This includes providing
                them with school uniforms and dignity packs that include basic
                hygiene supplies. We also support learning more broadly by
                providing mentorship sessions to the students through school
                visits.

                We recognize that teachers are key players within the
                educational ecosystem and thus key drivers of educational
                outcomes within communities. However, even as the teaching
                context and the demands on teachers expand, they are not always
                provided with the skills and tools they require to remain
                effective in their practice. We run a 5-day teacherâ€™s training
                fellowship where we train teachers on various topics including
                mental health and wellbeing, pedagogical strategies, digital
                skills and child protection.

                We promote life-long learning by providing community education

                rights, climate change & environmental management, drugs and
                substance abuse, and disputes and conflict management.
